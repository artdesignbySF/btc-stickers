Free sticker pack. Happy stickering!

These were first made as a telegram sticker pack for the Noderunners.
I've left them at RGB color value, as some printers these days want you to hand files over in RGB (idk why).
They are 300 dpi. 
Could be a bit cleaner, but hey, its free, and I've more plans to try and get to fruition ;)

Consider donating (i'm having some node issues rn, so temp custodial solutions, sry)
